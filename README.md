# Ups
ðŸŒŽðŸ”º Localized curation contract for Antelope blockchains

This contract is currently under re-development. 

It will allow you to integrate ups (upvoting) in your application using unique identifiers for content on the web. 

Each domain + TLD (youtube.com) is registered on the contract, and works like a subreddit, where individual URLs on the address are upvoted in a curation system. 

This contract also allows for upvoting Atomic Assets NFT collections.
